# Udemy-Youtube-Lynda-Video-Learning-Helper

Helps you to acquire skills from Udemy, youtube, and Lynda educational videos more efficiently using simple keystrokes for speed and skip buttons.

This code is only compatible for the Mozilla Firefox browser at the moment.

Uses the AutoHotKey open-source software for windows to automate keypresses. Attached in the repository is the program and script that should be run when you right click them.



## The shortcut keys:

While in udemy.com with the Mozilla Firefox browswer, open a course and begin absorbing the content videos. 

* To speed up the video faster, type: r
* To slow down the video, type: e
* To skip 15 seconds ahead, type: f
* To go back 15 seconds, type: d
* To suspend the program, type: ctrl + alt + s   

Note: The suspend hot keyboard shortcut only works if you change line 50 of the udemy.ahk file located in this repository. Change the line where it says
```
C:\Users\User\Desktop\udemy.ahk
```
to a new file path location where the udemy.ahk is located in your own system. The above file path location is unique for my own system.

## Dependencies
